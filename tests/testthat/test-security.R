# OSS Index dependency vulnerability audit (oysteR / Sonatype).
#
# `oysteR::audit_description()` resolves the installed DESCRIPTION and audits
# the package's hard dependencies against the Sonatype OSS Index. It is a
# network test that requires OSS Index credentials (OSSINDEX_USER /
# OSSINDEX_TOKEN): the API rejects unauthenticated requests with HTTP 401.
#
# Scope: hard dependencies only -- `Depends` + `Imports`, never `Suggests`.
#
# `oysteR::expect_secure()` audits `Depends` + `Imports` + `Suggests`, and
# `Suggests` drags in the recursive dependency trees of the dev tooling --
# including oysteR's own, which reaches `curl` through httr. So the gate was
# failing on a vulnerability in the auditor rather than in anything a user of
# ssrfr installs.
#
# Measured in seor 2026-09-10, same machine and credentials:
#
#     fields = Depends+Imports             12 packages audited, clean
#     fields = Depends+Imports+Suggests    87 packages audited, reports curl
#
# ssrfr imports `curl` directly, so its hard closure does carry it, and the
# two curl advisories it reports are dispositioned in helper-security.R.
#
# A package's security posture is what it makes users install, so the audit
# calls `audit_description()` directly with the narrower `fields`.
# `expect_secure()` sets a CRAN mirror internally and `audit_description()`
# does not, hence the explicit `repos` option.
#
# WHERE THIS RUNS, AND WHY THE PRECONDITIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS SKIPS.
#
# Everywhere ordinary -- a local `testthat::test_local()`, the pre-push verify
# gate, a plain `R CMD check --as-cran` -- a missing precondition is a skip.
# That is right: a developer without OSS Index credentials is not a security
# regression.
#
# In the ONE place that exists to run this audit, it is not right. seor's
# `security-audit` CI job once had no credentials (measured 2026-09-11 in
# seor: the project carried zero CI/CD variables), so `skip_if()` fired, the
# job reported success, and nothing had been audited -- the failure
# `PUNY-rsxtbbln` records in punycoder. A green job that audited nothing is
# worse than no job, because it answers the question it was never asked.
#
# So that job now sets OSSINDEX_AUDIT_REQUIRED=true, and under that flag every
# precondition below becomes a hard failure with a message naming what is
# missing. The flag is set in `.gitlab-ci.yml` and nowhere else, so no other
# context changes behavior.
#
# NOTE ON THE PRE-PUSH HOOK. scripts/verify.R's test stage runs with
# NOT_CRAN=true and fails on any skipped test, so it leaves this file and
# test-osv.R out: a developer without credentials would otherwise be blocked,
# and the audit is the scheduled `security-audit` job's to run. Its R CMD
# check stage runs this file with NOT_CRAN=false, where the audit skips and
# the offline allow-list tests still run.
