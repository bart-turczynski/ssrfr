#
# Fail fast when the MACHINE, not the tree, is what makes the verify gate red.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Twice on 2026-09-22, in two different repositories, the
# local gate was red before anything had been changed, and both times the fix
# was to the machine rather than to any tracked file (SEOR-tcytizic):
#
#   robotstxtr  dev/check-docs-drift.R aborted on roxygen2 skew -- 8.1.0
#               installed, 8.0.0 pinned. Fixed with
#               pak::pkg_install("roxygen2@8.0.0").
#   seor        R CMD check WARNING "package 'pslr' was built under R version
#               4.6.1" on a machine running 4.6.0. Fixed by reinstalling the
#               fleet members from CRAN SOURCE under the running R.
#
# Both cost real time and both LOOKED LIKE A CODE DEFECT. An agent picking up a
# ticket sees a red gate and reasonably assumes its own change caused it; one
# spent a large fraction of its budget proving the failure was pre-existing by
# re-running the gate against a pristine worktree. That proof step is the right
# instinct and it should not be needed twice a day.
#
# The second failure is also the expensive kind: it surfaced as a WARNING deep
# inside R CMD check, minutes in, wearing the costume of a package problem.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS.
#
# 1. roxygen2's installed version equals this package's
#    `Config/roxygen2/version`. That field is the record -- there is no second
#    place to keep the pin in sync with, and all eight fleet DESCRIPTIONs
#    already carry it. A mismatch means `devtools::document()` would rewrite
#    man/ in a different dialect, which is why the docs-drift guards abort.
#
# 2. No package reachable on .libPaths() was BUILT under a newer R than the one
#    running. R records the build version in each installed package's
#    DESCRIPTION, and `R CMD check` turns a newer build into a WARNING --
#    which, with `error_on = "warning"`, is a failed gate. Older builds within
#    the same major are left alone: R loads them and does not warn, so flagging
#    them would be noise.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.
#
# * It pins no R version of its own. The rule that matters is RELATIVE -- fleet
#   members must be built under whatever R is running here -- so a recorded
#   constant would be a second thing to keep in sync and a new way to be wrong.
#   Check 2 compares against the live interpreter and needs no record.
# * It installs nothing and repairs nothing. It prints the command that fixes
#   what it found and exits 1. A gate that silently mutates the machine is a
#   gate nobody can reason about.
# * It is offline and touches no network.
