# check-citation v3
"""Citation-metadata consistency gate.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `CITATION.cff` and `.zenodo.json` each duplicate two facts out
of `DESCRIPTION` - the version and the project URLs - and nothing asserted that
either copy was right. Measured across the fleet 2026-09-11, four of the seven
repositories carrying the files disagreed with `DESCRIPTION`, one of them with
itself (SEOR-lreejxat). seor's own `CITATION.cff` and `.zenodo.json` were still
pointing at `https://bart-turczynski.gitlab.io/seor/`, an address that belongs
to no project on this host and returns 403; `DESCRIPTION` and `_pkgdown.yml`
had been corrected and these two were missed, because nothing looked.

Same shape as `rurl`'s `tools/cran-comments-gate.R`, which exists because
`cran-comments.md` drifted eleven releases unnoticed. This is that check for
these two files.

WHAT IT CHECKS.

1. `CITATION.cff` `version:` equals the release the `DESCRIPTION` `Version:`
   names, per design/adr/0002-citation-urls-are-the-ones-about-this-package.md:
   `X.Y.Z.9000` names `X.Y.Z`; a package that has never released (the named
   release is `0.0.0`) carries the development version verbatim.
2. `.zenodo.json` `"version"`, same rule.
3. A package that has never released carries no `date-released` and no DOI -
   the honesty clause that makes the exception in (1) defensible.
4. Every http(s) URL those two files declare ABOUT THIS PACKAGE appears in
   `DESCRIPTION`'s `URL:`. For `.zenodo.json` that means the
   `related_identifiers` whose `relation` is self-referential and NOT the ones
   pointing at a dependency or an upstream source, which are not facts
   duplicated out of `DESCRIPTION` at all - see `SELF_REFERENTIAL_RELATIONS`
   and design/adr/0002-citation-urls-are-the-ones-about-this-package.md.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK, ON PURPOSE.

* `codemeta.json` is out of scope here. Its `issueTracker` is `/-/work_items`
  on purpose, while `BugReports:` keeps the `/-/issues` form CRAN's incoming
  check demands (SEOR-ocbtrrnl), so a gate equating the two would force one of
  them wrong. `scripts/check-bugreports.py` owns that split instead.
* Nothing here touches the network. Whether a declared URL resolves is a fact
  about the rest of the world; `R CMD check --as-cran` already fetches declared
  URLs, and wiring a network call into a pre-push gate makes every push fail on
  a train.

Stdlib only, so it runs in any repository in the fleet without adding a
dependency, and in a bare Python CI image. `CITATION.cff` is read with a
deliberately small top-level-scalar reader rather than a YAML parser for the
same reason; it refuses to guess when the file does not have that shape.

# --- fleet sync --------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THIS FILE IS VENDORED. A copy lives in all eight fleet repositories, and it is
# vendored rather than shared on purpose: each package has to stay
# self-contained, because a fresh clone's pre-commit hooks and a CRAN tarball
# cannot depend on a sibling checkout being present.
#
# The price of vendoring is silent drift, and the fleet has already paid it.
# Measured 2026-09-23, the eight copies had five distinct sha256 sums; nothing
# anywhere recorded which was correct. The digest below is what stops the next
# one being silent. It covers the IMPLEMENTATION -- every byte below the module
# docstring, minus this assignment -- so the prose above stays free to differ
# per repository, which it must (each repository's `codemeta.json` is a
# different situation, and four separate rewrites of that bullet are what
# produced the five sums), while any change to behavior is caught.
#
# Bytes rather than a parse-tree hash on purpose: an `ast.dump()` digest would
# be hostage to the Python version running the gate, which is the same class of
# failure as SEOR-tcytizic and not one worth importing here.
#
# `main()` verifies it on every run, so the check is armed in all eight gates
# regardless of which of them pass `--self-test`. A logic change therefore
# cannot land in one repository without someone consciously re-blessing the
# digest, and because the constant is a literal, whether the fleet agrees is
# one grep:
#
#     grep -h '^IMPLEMENTATION_DIGEST' ~/Projects/*/scripts/check-citation.py | sort -u
#
# One line out means eight implementations in sync. Re-bless it in all eight
# repositories in the same change, never in one (SEOR-tssbiedr).

# so the identifier is a fact duplicated out of DESCRIPTION and has to agree
# with it. Every other relation points at a DIFFERENT artifact -- a dependency,
# an upstream source -- which has no business in DESCRIPTION's `URL:` field.
#
# Measured across the seven repositories carrying `.zenodo.json` (2026-09-11):
# these three relations account for 10 identifiers, every one of them declared
# in DESCRIPTION; `requires`, `isRequiredBy` and `isDerivedFrom` account for 7,
# not one of them declared. 17 entries, no counterexample either way.
#
# It is an allowlist of what to CHECK rather than a denylist of what to skip,
# because the costs are not symmetric. A false positive reds this gate in every
# repository at once -- it did exactly that in five of seven, which is how this
# rule was found. A false negative only misses a duplicated URL that
# `CITATION.cff`'s own `url:` / `repository-code:` fields still cross-check.
