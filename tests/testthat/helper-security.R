# Disposition machinery for the OSS Index dependency audit in
# test-security.R. The allow-list lives here rather than in the test file
# because more than one test block reads it -- the offline well-formedness
# check and the network audit itself.
#
# WHY THESE ROWS. The contract this file implements is "every reported
# advisory has a current, explicit disposition", replacing "the scan reports
# nothing" (SEOR-fkvlzltx). ssrfr imports `curl` directly, and measured
# 2026-10-03 with live OSS Index credentials the hard dependency closure (18
# components) reports exactly two advisories, both against curl 8.0.0, CRAN's
# current release, so no available version clears either. Each row below says
# why the advisory does not reach a fetch made through ssrfr. Rows are added
# only for advisories the audit reports today: rule B fails a row that is not
# currently reported, so an anticipatory row is stale on arrival.
#
# Three rules keep the list honest. test-security.R enforces them:
#
#   A  UNEXPECTED  an advisory reported and not allow-listed FAILS. This is
#                  the gate still doing its job.
#   B  STALE       an allow-listed advisory NO LONGER reported FAILS. An
#                  allow-list may not over-permit; a row that has outlived its
#                  justification is deleted, not left to widen the exemption
#                  silently.
#   C  DRIFT       past its review date, or audited at a package version later
#                  than `version_seen`, a row WARNS. Deliberately not a
#                  failure: a calendar date that turns every push red is how a
#                  gate teaches people to reach for --no-verify.
#
# Adding a row is a decision, not a formality. Rule B is what keeps it one.
#
# The reference implementation is seor's; sitemapr carries the same two curl
# rows for its own reasons.
