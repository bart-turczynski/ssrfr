# Generated-docs drift gate: fails if man/, NAMESPACE or DESCRIPTION differ
# from what roxygen2 would regenerate from the roxygen comments in R/.
#
# Why this exists: a stale .Rd is still perfectly valid .Rd, so nothing else in
# the gate can see it. lintr::lint_package() reads R/ and never looks at man/;
# spelling::spell_check_package() reads man/ as it is; R CMD check --as-cran
# validates the Rd it is given, not whether that Rd still matches its source
# comment. The fleet's logo sweep added man/figures/logo.svg without re-running
# devtools::document(), so pslr's man/pslr-package.Rd went on describing a
# package with no logo, and nothing in its gate noticed (SEOR-oopopupm).
# Regenerating and diffing is the only thing that catches it (SEOR-nwfmerhu).
# Ported from pslr's scripts/check-docs-drift.R, itself from robotstxtr's
# dev/check-docs-drift.R (ROBO-cbzemsnq).
#
# DESCRIPTION is watched too. roxygenise() owns two of its fields:
# Config/roxygen2/version (pinned below, so it cannot move here) and Collate,
# which it rewrites from @include tags. A stale Collate is drift like a stale
# .Rd.
#
# Roxygen runs through its default loader, the same one devtools::document()
# uses, so what this gate demands is exactly what the documented fix produces.
# A cheaper loader (load_code = "source") evaluates package code differently,
# so a future dynamic doc could make the gate reject a tree that document()
# considers clean -- an unfixable failure, the worst kind for a gate to have.
#
# Never run in place by the gate: roxygenise() writes into the directory it is
# given. Run in the working tree, it would rewrite man/, NAMESPACE and
# DESCRIPTION there, and it would check the working tree, uncommitted edits
# included, rather than the commit being pushed. scripts/check-docs-drift.sh
# (the docs-drift pre-push hook) therefore runs it against its own
# `git archive` export of that commit (PRE_COMMIT_TO_REF, else HEAD).
#
# Usage (from the package root):
#   Rscript scripts/check-docs-drift.R [package-dir]
#
# On drift the script prints the diff, exits 1, and LEAVES the regenerated
# files in place: run by hand against a working tree, the fix is then already
# applied and only needs committing. Run by scripts/check-docs-drift.sh, the
# regenerated files are in a throwaway export, so the working tree is never
# touched.

# Exact-equality version gate. roxygen2 changes its output formatting between
# releases, so an unpinned runner reports version skew as drift -- and when the

# Refusing to guess keeps every failure this gate reports a real one.
# scripts/check-toolchain.R (the check-toolchain pre-push hook) reports the
